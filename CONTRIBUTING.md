# Contributing to Simple Load Balancer Project

## Welcome Contributors!

We appreciate your interest in improving our Simple Load Balancer project. This document provides guidelines to help you contribute effectively and smoothly.

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a load balancer in Go using a Round Robin algorithm, with multiple RESTful APIs as backend services. Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the project's structure and goals.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.16 or higher
- Git
- MongoDB (for running backend APIs)

### Setup
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your forked repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arpit529Srivastava/Why-take-load.git
   cd Why-Take-Load
   ```
3. Initialize Go modules
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

## 3. Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
- Use a descriptive branch name
  ```sh
  git checkout -b feature/add-health-check-improvements
  git checkout -b bugfix/resolve-proxy-timeout-issue
  ```

### Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense and imperative mood
  ```sh
  # Good commit message
  git commit -m "Add advanced health check mechanism for backend servers"
  
  # Avoid
  git commit -m "Added some changes to health checking"
  ```

## 4. Code Quality

### Coding Standards
- Follow Go standard formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
